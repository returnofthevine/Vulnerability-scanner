This is a basic vulnerability detection scanner written in python to detect possible SQL Injection and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) threats. 

The POST request's contents in this code contains a payload that can cause SQL injection. A notice is printed if the response includes the string "SQL syntax," which is seen as a strong indication of a SQL injection vulnerability. The absence of the string is regarded as a negative indicator, and a message is printed.

The code then makes an attempt to obtain data from the database if SQL injection is discovered by inserting a different payload in the data of a future POST request. A message is printed and the response is deemed successful if it contains the string "SQL syntax." A message is printed and regarded an unsuccessful data retrieval if the string is missing.

Note that this code is a very basic example and may not detect all instances of SQL injection or work with all database systems. In a real-world scenario, you would want to expand the check to include a wider range

This code also checks the headers of the response for a header with the key "CSRF". If the header exists, it's considered a positive indicator of CSRF protection and the header's value is printed. If the header does not exist, it's considered a negative indicator of CSRF protection and a message is printed.
